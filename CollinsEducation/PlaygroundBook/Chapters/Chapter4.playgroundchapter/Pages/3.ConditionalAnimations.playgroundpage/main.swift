 **Goal:** Learn how to make a conditional animation.
 
 We learned the `animate()` function, which allows you to do a single animation.
 
 We also have another function `startAnimation()` that will allows you to run an animation indefinitely, until you tell the drone to stop with a `stopAnimation()` command. This is usefull when you are using conditional statements in your program, for example.
 
 Remember, the drone will move until you send the `stopAnimation` command. So use it carefully!
 
 There are several animations avaialable: `flashlights`, `blinklights`, `oscillatelights`, `spin`, `tap`, `slowshake`, `metronome`, `ondulation`, `spinposture`, `spiral`, `slalom`
 
 1. steps: Place your drone on a flat surface with enough space around you.
 2. Try to **startAnimation** like blinkinglights, **wait** for 2 seconds, and **stopAnimation**.
 3. When you are ready, hit **Run My Code**, using Step Though. See how the `startAnimation` command returns immediately after execution!
