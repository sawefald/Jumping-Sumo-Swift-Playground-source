/*:#localized(key: "FirstProseBlock")
 **Goal:** Learn how to move forward and backward.

 1. steps: Place your drone on a flat surface with enough space around you.

 For this, direction is either `forward` or `backward`.
 
 ````
 move(direction: MoveDirection.forward, duration: 2)
 ````
 The example above will move the drone forward for 2 seconds.

 3. Try to **move forward** for 1 second and **move backward** for 1 second. Remember, you can use the `wait` command if you want.
 4. When you are ready, tap **Run My Code**.
