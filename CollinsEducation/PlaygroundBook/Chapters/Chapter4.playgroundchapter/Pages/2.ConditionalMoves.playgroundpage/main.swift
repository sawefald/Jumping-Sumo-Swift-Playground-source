 **Goal:** Learn how to make a conditional move.
 
 We learned the `move()` function, which allows you to move in one or multiple directions during a certain duration of time.
 
 We also have another `move()` function that will allows you to move indefinitely, until you tell the drone to stop with a `stopMoving()` command. This is usefull when you are using conditional statements in your program, for example.
 
 Remember, the drone will move until you send the `stopMoving` command. So use it carefully!
 
 1. steps: Place your drone on a flat surface with enough space around you.
 2. Try to **move** in a direction, **wait** for 2 seconds, and **stopMoving**.
 3. When you are ready, hit **Run My Code**, using Step Though. See how the `move` command returns immediately after execution!
