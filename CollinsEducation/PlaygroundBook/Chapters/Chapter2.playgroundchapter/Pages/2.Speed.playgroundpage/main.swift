/*:#localized(key: "FirstProseBlock")
 **Goal:** Learn how to control speed.
 
 1. steps: Place your drone on a flat surface with enough space around you.
 2. The command to change the speed of the drone is

 `droneSpeed = value`

 The [variable](glossary://variable) represents the percentage of the drone max speed: **50** is half speed, **100** is full speed.

 4. Try to move forward 2 seconds at 10%, then backward 2 seconds at 10%
 5. Try again, this time at 80%.
 6. Think about how far you the drone went at the different speeds.
 7. When you are ready, tap **Run My Code**.
