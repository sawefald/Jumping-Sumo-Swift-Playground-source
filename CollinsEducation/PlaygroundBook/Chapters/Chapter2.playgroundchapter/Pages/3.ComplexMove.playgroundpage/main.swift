 **Goal:** Learn how to make complex moves.
  
 We learned the `move()` function, which allows you to move in one direction at a time.
 
 To move in multiple directions at the same time, there is another `move` function that takes all both directions as parameters.
 
 Every [parameter](glossary://parameter) defines the move speed on its axis, and the rotation speed. The drone will move in all specified directions at the same time.
 
 `move(speed:value, turn:value, duration:value)`

  - speed: longitudinal speed in %, positive to move forward, negative to move backward.
  - turn: lateral speed in %, positive to turn right, negative to turn left.

 ````
 move(speed:20, turn:20, duration:2)
 ````
 
 1. steps: Place your drone on a flat surface with enough space around you.
 2. Try this above command first to see how the drone reacts, before making you own experiment.
 3. When you are ready, hit **Run My Code**.
