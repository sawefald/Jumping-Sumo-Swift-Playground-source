 **Challenge:** Move in a circle.

For the second challenge, you will make the drone follow a circle path. You will be using the complex move you have learned up to now! Create a [function](glossary://function) called `circle()`, using the move commands.
 
You may need to play with speed percentages to see how to make the circle.
