 **Goal:** Learn how to animate your drone

 1. steps: Place your drone on a flat surface with enough space around you.
 2. The command to perform jump with the drone is

 `jump(jumpType: JumpType)`

 The [jump](glossary://jump) is the type of activity the drone will do on its own once commanded.

 For this, jumps are `high` or `long`.
 
 ````
 jump(jumpType: JumpType.long)
 ````
 The example above will have the drone perform a long jump.

 3. Try the **long jump** followed by the **high jump**.
 4. When you are ready, tap **Run My Code**.
