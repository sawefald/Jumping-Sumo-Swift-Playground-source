/*:#localized(key: "FirstProseBlock")
 **Goal:** Learn how to animate your drone

 1. steps: Place your drone on a flat surface with enough space around you.
 2. The command to perform a simple animation of the drone is

 `animate(animation: Animations)`

 The [animation](glossary://animation) is the type of activity the drone will do on its own once commanded.

 For this, animations are `spin`, `tap`, `slowshake`, `metronome`, `ondulation`, `spintoposture`, `spiral`, and `slalom`
 
 ````
 animate(animation: Animations.spin)
 ````
 The example above will have the drone perform a spin animation.

 3. Try the **spin animation** followed by the **slowshake animation**.
 4. When you are ready, tap **Run My Code**.
