 **Goal:** Learn how to turn left and right.

 1. steps: Place your drone on a flat surface with enough space around you.
 2. You will use the same command you just learned:

 `move(direction: MoveDirection, duration: value)`

 For this, direction is either `left` or `right`.
 
 ````
 move(direction: MoveDirection.left, duration: 2)
 ````
 The example above will move the drone left for 2 seconds.

 3. Try to **move left** for 1 second and **move right** for 1 second.
 
 4. When you are ready, tap **Run My Code**.
