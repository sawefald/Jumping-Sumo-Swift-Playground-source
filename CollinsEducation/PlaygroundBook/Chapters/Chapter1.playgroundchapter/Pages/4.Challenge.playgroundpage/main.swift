 **Challenge:** Move in a square.

For the first challenge, you will make the drone follow a square path. You will be using all the commands you have learned up to now! Create a [function](glossary://function) called `square()`, using the move commands.
 
You may need to play with how long to turn for to make a 90 degree turn.
