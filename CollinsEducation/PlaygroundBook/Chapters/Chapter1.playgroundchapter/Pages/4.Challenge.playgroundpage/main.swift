 **Challenge:** Move in a pattern.

For the first challenge, you will make the drone move in a pattern return to it's starting point. You will be using all the commands you have learned up to now! Create a [function](glossary://function) called `pattern()`, using the move commands.
 
You must move at least 4 times to be successful.
 
You may need to play with how long to turn to return to your starting position.
